[^2]: Bessie 
[^3]: 12 o’clock in the morning 
[^4]: Refer to footnote \#8
[^5]: Original: *Run*; Emendation: *Ran*
[^6]: It is unclear if employing “that” at the end of the sentence is indicative of a slang phase or if Kezia didn’t finish her thought. 
[^7]: 2 o’clock in the morning 
[^8]: Here Kezia employs an apostrophe. Hence, the reason for my emendation in May 14 entry as I believe it was an accidental variant. 
[^9]: Kezia emendation from *th* to *rd*
[^10]: Original: *give*; Emendation: *gave*
[^11]: Original: *a*; Emendation: *and*
