##### WEDNESDAY  
**April 12<sup><u><i>th</i></u></sup>** Well, here I am starting another book  
of my life <span style="color: #CC00FF ">[</span>,<span style="color: #CC00FF ">]</span> I hope it will be as interesting as  
the first one is. I will now proceed to tell the  
events of the day. First thing on the program,  
Bessie and I went down on the beach. I read in a   
book, Bessie wrote a letter, we also went to the  
store for the mail (not male.) This evening Sollie  
cut Bessie’s and my hair, Don’t we look like seven  
hundred dollars though? Ha! Ha! Lottie and I walked  
up to the store this evening, quite a time, we had.  

##### THURSDAY  
**April 13<sup><u><i>th</i></u></sup>** Bessie, Lester and I walked over to <span style="color: #70AD47">Georgetown</span>  
to go to South Bend with the Indians in their  
launch but they didn’t go, so we walked to   
<span style="color: #70AD47">Tokeland</span> and went on the <span style="color: #70AD47">Shamrock</span>. Walked  
six miles in one hour. <span style="color: #A50021">Going some</span>. Oh, that  
Kit Mooney is a <span style="color: #A50021"> rustler</span> alright. Mooney came  
up to Ev’s for supper, then we four walked  
down <span style="color: #70AD47">Broadway</span>.
