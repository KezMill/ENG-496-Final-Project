Fork</span> in Howe’s wagon . The road was   
long and weary, and I was cold and   
dreary,  so I didn’t enjoy it very much. Was  
glad when we arrived at Fishburn Castle.  
Two houses burned down this morning.  
I got up at about 4 o'clock this  “        ”   
and watched the smoke curl up over  
the hill. Bess, Laurence and I went  
down town and up to see the ruins.  
Feel pretty good to-day. Considering the  
fight Bess and I had last night.

Never had much anyway.
